# Task 
 The task is to design a two-stage, balanced amplifier for high frequency technologies course in 2023-2024. The amplifier is to be composed of two stages, with the first stage being a single amplifier and the second stage being a balanced amplifier. The balanced amplifier is to have two amplifiers, two phase shifters, and two Wilkinson power dividers/combiners. The circuit is to be designed in microstrip technology, using a dielectric substrate, and the CAD tool to be used is Cadence AWR. The design is to follow specific steps, starting from theoretical analysis to final layout generation, with verification and adjustments at each step. The final layout should be geometrically sound and possible, with all elements integrated to form a complete layout. The amplifier is to fulfill specifications for center frequency, relative bandwidth, return loss, attenuation, and measured power at the monitor port. SMD components are to be used for all lumped elements, and the substrates available for the microstrip structure are Fiberglass (FR4), RT/Duroid 5880, RT/Duroid 6006 and RT/Duroid 6010.2LM. The final report should contain justification for design decisions, plots of performance and characteristics of circuit elements, and microstrip circuit layout, among other things.
