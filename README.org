* Design a Two Stage Balanced Amplifier in AWR Microwave Office

This project was done for the subject High Frequency Technology taught in the [[https://www.uc3m.es/bachelor-degree/data-telecommunicaton][Dual Bachelor in Data Science and Engineering and Telecommunication Technologies Engineering]].

The final grade was given the maximum grade of 10 out 10.

The main focus was on designing and understanding a two-stage microwave amplifier. Our goal was to create a device that can increase the power of microwave signals efficiently for a specific frequency range.

For this implementation we used a commercial integrated amplifier with a high frequency circuit implemented in microstrip technology.

The whole circuit was designed and simulated with AWR Microwave Office, you can check the main file [[./awr_simulation.emp][here]].

The main part of this project were:
- Study of the best suitable dielectric for the project.
- Design and implementation of a Wilkinson power divider/combiner.
- Development of a band pass filter implemented with coupled lines.
- Architecture of a directional coupler
